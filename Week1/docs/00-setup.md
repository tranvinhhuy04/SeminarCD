    ```bash
    # Bash/Zsh
    code --list-extensions | grep github.copilot
    ```

    ```powershell
    # PowerShell
    code --list-extensions | Select-String "github.copilot"
    ```

   If you see nothing, it means you haven't installed those extensions yet. Run the following command to install the extensions.

    ```bash
    code --install-extension "github.copilot" --force && code --install-extension "github.copilot-chat" --force
    ```

### Set-up MCP Servers

1. Make sure Docker Desktop is up and running if you use VS Code on your local machine.
1. Set the environment variable of `$REPOSITORY_ROOT`.

   ```bash
   # bash/zsh
   REPOSITORY_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
   ```

   ```powershell
   # PowerShell
   $REPOSITORY_ROOT = git rev-parse --show-toplevel
   ```

1. Copy MCP server settings.

    ```bash
    # bash/zsh
    cp -r $REPOSITORY_ROOT/docs/.vscode/. \
          $REPOSITORY_ROOT/.vscode/
    ```

    ```powershell
    # PowerShell
    Copy-Item -Path $REPOSITORY_ROOT/docs/.vscode/* `
              -Destination $REPOSITORY_ROOT/.vscode/ -Recurse -Force
    ```

1. Open Command Palette by typing F1 or `Ctrl`+`Shift`+`P` on Windows or `Cmd`+`Shift`+`P` on Mac OS, and search `MCP: List Servers`.
1. Choose `context7` then click `Start Server`.
1. Choose `awesome-copilot` then click `Start Server`.

## Check GitHub Copilot Agent Mode

1. Click the GitHub Copilot icon on the top of GitHub Codespace or VS Code and open GitHub Copilot window.

   ![Open GitHub Copilot Chat](./images/setup-02.png)

1. If you're asked to login or sign up, do it. It's free of charge.
1. Make sure you're using GitHub Copilot Agent Mode.

   ![GitHub Copilot Agent Mode](./images/setup-03.png)

1. Select model to either `GPT-4.1` or `Claude Sonnet 4`.

## Configure Beast Mode

1. Enter the `/mcp.awesome-copilot.get_search_prompt`, followed by entering keywords like "beast mode"

   It should show list of beast chatmodes. Enter a prompt similar to `4.1 Beast Chat Mode`. Then it will save it under the `.github/chatmodes` directory.

1. Choose the `4.1-Beast` mode instead of the `Agent` mode. It will automatically change LLM to `GPT 4.1`.

1. Set the environment variable of `$REPOSITORY_ROOT`.

   ```bash
   # bash/zsh
   REPOSITORY_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
   ```

   ```powershell
   # PowerShell
   $REPOSITORY_ROOT = git rev-parse --show-toplevel
   ```

1. Copy workspace settings.

    ```bash
    # bash/zsh
    cp $REPOSITORY_ROOT/docs/.vscode/settings.json \
       $REPOSITORY_ROOT/.vscode/settings.json
    ```

    ```powershell
    # PowerShell
    Copy-Item -Path $REPOSITORY_ROOT/docs/.vscode/settings.json `
              -Destination $REPOSITORY_ROOT/.vscode/settings.json -Force
    ```

## Prepare Custom Instructions

1. Set the environment variable of `$REPOSITORY_ROOT`.

   ```bash
   # bash/zsh
   REPOSITORY_ROOT=$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)
   ```

   ```powershell
   # PowerShell
   $REPOSITORY_ROOT = git rev-parse --show-toplevel
   ```

1. Copy custom instructions.

    ```bash
    # bash/zsh
    cp -r $REPOSITORY_ROOT/docs/custom-instructions/setup/. \
          $REPOSITORY_ROOT/.github/
    ```

    ```powershell
    # PowerShell
    Copy-Item -Path $REPOSITORY_ROOT/docs/custom-instructions/setup/* `
              -Destination $REPOSITORY_ROOT/.github/ -Recurse -Force
    ```

## Analyze Product Requirements Document (PRD) and Design API

1. Make sure that you're using GitHub Copilot Agent Mode with the model of `Claude Sonnet 4` or `GPT-4.1`.
1. Add [`product-requirements.md`](../product-requirements.md) to GitHub Copilot.
1. Enter the prompt like the following for GitHub Copilot Agent to generate an OpenAPI document for you. This OpenAPI document will be the base of your entire application.

    ```text
    Here's the PRD for you. Carefully read through the entire PRD and do the following for me.
    
    - Identify all the steps first, which you're going to do.
    - Generate an OpenAPI document in YAML format.
    - The OpenAPI document should capture all API endpoints, parameters and request/response payloads.
    - Assume the API server is `http://localhost:8080` and the base URL is `/api`.
    - Save it to the `openapi.yaml` file at the repository root.
    ```

1. Verify the `openapi.yaml` is generated at the repository root.
1. Click the `[keep]` button of GitHub Copilot to take the `openapi.yaml` file.
